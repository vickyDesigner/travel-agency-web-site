                            workshops in Venice were moved to prevent fires, causing a glass battle. There is a myth
                            that the technicians are putting technicians on board to prevent glass craft technology from
                            leaking out. You can buy quality glasses cheaper than other places, and you can see yourself
                            in the glass field by visiting the glass shop.There is a glass museum on the island and a
